# python-renamer
Python Renamer is a simple yet efficient tool for batch renaming files using regular expressions. It scans the `files_input` folder, applies renaming rules, and outputs the renamed files into `files_output`.  This project is designed to demonstrate concepts like file manipulation, regex processing, automation, and unit testing in Python.
